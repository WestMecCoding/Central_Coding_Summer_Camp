# Lego Spike Soccer Bot Game Instructions

## The Game

The objective of the game is to build and program a wheeled robot that is able to capture and maneuver a game ball in different directions.

There will be three phases of the game.

In the first phase the robot will move in a straight direction to capture the ball and continue in a straight line to push the ball across the finish line.

In the 2nd phase, the bot will move forward to capture the ball, make a 90 degree turn and deliver the ball across an adjacent finish line.

In the 3rd phase, the bot will move forward to capture the ball,
make a 180 degree turn and deliver the ball across the originating finish line.

## Scoring the Game

The game will be scored in the following manner:

> Teams of similar color names will compete against each other in three successive "phases" or "rounds" which have been described above.

> Any team that completes the objective of the first phase will receive 1 point.

> Any team that completes the objective of the second phase will receive 2 points.

> Any team that completes the objective of the third phase will receive 3 points.

> Any team that does not arrive to their game area with their bot in position when time has been called will forfeit that round  
> and 1 point will be awarded to the opposing team.

> Teams are only allowed to perform the objective of the current round or prior rounds. Teams may not attempt an objective of a future round.

> Teams have unlimited attempts to perform the objective of the round within the allotted time of the round. The lead programmer may modify the program code within the alotted time.

> The lead engineer may modify the bot within the allotted time of the round.

> A team that is not able to complete the objective of a round may take the option to complete the objective of a previous round for points equal to the previous round's objective.

> Example: Team 2 does not believe their robot can complete the objective of round 3, so they take the option to attempt the objective of round 2. If successful they would be awarded two points. If unsuccessful they would receive no points.

> At the end of the phases, if there is a tie between two competing teams, the teams will have a two minute run-off to score as many points as possible. Any objectives of any phase may be attempted as many times as the team's prefer within the two minute window.

> The team with the highest number of points will be declared the winner of their color's competition. The second team will be declared the "Runner-Up".

> The team with the overall highest score of the session will be declared that session's "Champion". If there is an overall points tie, the tied teams will have a run-off similar to the color round run-off.

| Notes   | Team Red 1x1 completed objective 1, but Team Red 2x2 did not. Red 1x1 received 1 point for the round | Red 1x1 did not arrive to the game floor on time, so Red 2x2 was awarded 1 point. Red 2x2 also completed the 2nd phase objective and was awarded a further 2 points for a total of 3. | Red 1x1 was able to complete the objective of Phase 3 and was awarded 3 points. Red 2x2 chose the option to perform the 1st phase objective and was successful so they were awarded 1 point. | In the tie-breaking run-off Red1x1 chose to attempt the 3rd phase objective and was successful 1 time in 2 minutes. Red 2x2 chose to attempt the Phase 1 objective multiple times and was successfull twice. So the overall winner was team Red 1x1 |

## Other Rule Specifications

> The ball will be placed in the center of the game area on the marking tape.

> The front tires of the bot must be placed over the top of the starting line tape.

> The ball must cross over the plane of the goal line tape. Balls that roll diagonally across a corner line will not be counted.

> No team may modify the code or the build or obstruct the opposing team or any other team in any way or they will be disqualified from the event.
